# Denationalization of Money, BlockChain/DLT and IoV

## Denationalization of Money 货币民主化

- 根据Hayek的观点，国家政府不应该发行强制所有经济成员使用的特定货币，而应该允许私营企业发行自己的货币形式，并决定如何发行。
- Hayek主张建立一个私人货币体系，金融机构发行的货币相互竞争获得接受。
- 因此，用户会选择他们认为能在折旧和升值之间提供互相接受的交点的货币

## BlockChain/ DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology)

In **October 2008**, **Satoshi** **Nakamoto** proposed a combined digital asset and peer-to-peer payments system in his paper, *Bitcoin: A*  *Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System*

### Blockchain

Blockchain, 是一种database，把records组织成blocks，每个blocks通过cryptographic signature和下一个区块连接在一起。这种结构使得blockchain能够作为ledgers运行。

如果participants需要被预先决定，那么ledger是permissioned；

如果participants可以是所有人，那么ledger是unpermissioned；

A blockchain is **a type of database** that **organizes records into blocks**, with **each block linked to the next** through a **cryptographic signature.** 

This structure enables blockchains to function as **ledgers**, accessible and verifiable by anyone with the necessary permissions. 

When participants are preselected in the process, the ledger is considered permissioned. If the process is open to all, the ledger is unpermissioned.

### Ledgers

#### Unpermissioned Ledger 

Example: Bitcoin 

Features:

- **Lack a single owner**
- **Anyone** can contribute data and possess identical copies of the ledger
- Participants maintain ledger integrity through **consensus**
- Participative, peer-to-peer, distributed approach addressing authenticity, integrity, and identity

#### Permissioned Ledger 

Example: Government Authorities' Records 

Features:

- **May have one or more owners**
- Trusted actors or nodes maintain ledger integrity
- Simpler architecture and faster record maintenance
- **Decentralized** approach relying on **pre-selected trusted authorities**

#### Distributed Ledger 

Example: Ripple's Unique Node Validators 

Features:

- Spread across multiple sites, countries, or institutions
- **Public** accessibility
- Records stored sequentially in a **continuous** ledger
- Participants must reach a quorum to add new records
- **Trust** in validators or ledger operators is crucial

#### Shared Ledger 

Example: Consortium Database for Supply Chain Management 

Features:

- **Shared by an industry consortium or the public**
- Use distributed ledgers or blockchains as underlying databases
- Layered permissions for different user types
- Utilizes smart contracts to automate execution based on predefined terms and conditions

#### Summary

1. 非许可账本：如比特币。任何人都可以参与，账本由共识维护。
2. 许可账本：例如政府机构的记录。受信任的机构维护账本完整性。
3. 分布式账本：如瑞波的节点验证器。记录存储在多个地点，参与者必须达成共识。
4. 共享账本：例如供应链管理的联盟数据库。多个参与者共享，并根据权限层次进行访问控制。

### Blockchain and DLT

DLT建立于a series of networks of databases，运行participants create, store, desseminate information。blockchain把它们chained一起。

participants基于一套protocols进行交流，如果reach unanimous agreement，那么这个transaction added to ledger。

participants-->miners（validating nodes in permissioned networks）

- DLT is built upon **a series of networks of databases** that **allow participants** to **create, disseminate, and store information** in an efficient and secure manner. A **Blockchain** is a **series of blocks of information** that are securely **chained together.**

- **Participants** communicate actively based on a set of protocols through which they exchange transactions and **reach unanimous agreemen**t that a transaction can be **added to the ledger**, and agree on the order (timestamp) in which the transaction is added.
- These **participants** are known as "**miners**" in unpermissioned networks and "**validating nodes**" in **permissioned networks**.



### Block Chain/Distributed Ledger Technology

DLT has to address several key issues:

- Trust (no central party/administrator/clearing house)
- Security (cryptography – integrity & authenticity, audit trail)
- Privacy (anonymity, accuracy, …… 6 principles in PDPO)
- Transparency (verification of all secure transactions)

## Layers of BlockChain/DLT

![image-20240301145040078](assets\image-20240301145040078.png)

### Network Layer

Function: handle communication between nodes in blockchain network

Protocols:  standard networking protocols, like TCP/IP, like P2P(facilitate the connection and data exchange between nodes)

Examples: gossip protocols and direct messaging.

### Consensus Layer

Function: reach an agreement among nodes on the state of the blockchain

Protocols: PoW, PoS, DPos

Examples:

### Validation Layer

Function: validate transaction and ensure they conform to the rules of blockchain/distributed ledger

Protocols: smart contract program

Examples: Ethereum uses Solidity for smart contracts.

### Incentive Layer

Function: provides incentives for participants to contribute resources and maintain network

Protocols: tokens

Examples: bitcoin use BTC as rewards

### Data Layer

Function: store and manages the data structure of blockchain/distribute ledger

Protocols: The data layer includes the structure of the blockchain

Examples: **Merkle** tree for efficient data **verification**, and the format of blocks and transactions.

### Consistency Layer

Function: ensure all nodes have a consistent view of blockchain

Protocols:  Mechanisms like checkpoints or synchronization protocols help nodes **maintain a synchronized and consistent view of the blockchain.**

Examples:

### Smart Contract Layer

Function: enables the execution of programmable

Protocols: smart contract platform, create and deploy smart contract

Examples: 

### Identity and Access Layer

Function: manages participants identify and access to network

Protocols:DLTs may incorporate identity management systems and access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized participants can interact with the network.

Examples:

### Interoperability Layer

Function: facilitates interaction between different DLT networks or with external systems

Protocols: 

Examples:

### Privacy Layer

Function: Addresses the privacy concerns of participants by enabling selective disclosure of information.

Protocols: zero-knowledge proof, protect the privacy of participants while still maintaining the integrity of the ledger.

Examples:

### Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)

Function: a cryptographic technique that allows one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any additional information. 

Using a ZKP is a way to prove that you know something without actually revealing what it is that you know.

Examples: imagine that you want to prove to someone that you’re a citizen of a country, without giving them your name or passport number. 

• With a ZKP-based identity solution, you could prove that you’re a citizen without revealing your identity

### Application Layer

Function: This layer represents the space where decentralized applications (DApps) or specific use-case functionalities are developed and deployed on top of the DLT infrastructure. 

• It encompasses the applications that interact with the DLT through smart contracts or other protocols

Protocols: 

Examples: DeFi

## Smart Contract, Consensus Models

### Smart Contract

A contract is an agreement between multiple parties with time, conditions and actions.

### Consensus Models

#### PoW

- Mechanism: Requires participants to solve mathematical puzzles to prevent system manipulation.
- Features:
  - Decentralized consensus mechanism.
  - Participants expend computational power to validate transactions.
  - Examples: Bitcoin, Ethereum (currently, transitioning to Proof of Stake).
- Example: Bitcoin's blockchain relies on PoW to validate and add new blocks to the chain, with miners competing to solve complex mathematical problems for block rewards.

#### PoS

- Mechanism: Validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold.
- Features:
  - Validators are selected to create and confirm blocks.
  - Less computational power is required compared to PoW.
  - Examples: Ethereum 2.0 (transitioning), Cardano, Tezos.
- Example: In Ethereum 2.0, users must stake a certain amount of ETH to become validators, who then validate and propose new blocks to the blockchain.

#### DPoS

- Pros:
  - Highly scalable and fast.
  - Democratic and inclusive.
  - Low entry threshold.
  - Energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.
- Cons:
  - Requires active community participation.
  - Vulnerable to centralization.
- Example: EOS, Tron, BitShares.

#### PBFT

- Mechanism: Achieves consensus among a network of nodes despite the presence of faulty nodes.
- Features:
  - Tolerates up to one-third of nodes being faulty.
  - Nodes communicate to reach consensus about decisions.
  - Provides high fault tolerance.
- Example: Zilliqa, Hyperledger, Stellar, Ripple.
- Use Cases: Increases scalability and authenticity, energy and cost-efficient alternative to other consensus mechanisms.



## dApp, DAO

### dApp

digital applications or programs that exist and run on a blockchain or peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers instead of a single computer. 

### DAO

 an organization represented by  rules encoded as a transparent computer program,  controlled by the organization members, and not  influenced by a central government. 

DAO（分散自治组织），有时也被称为分散自治公司（DAC），是一种由规则编码成透明的计算机程序代表的组织，由组织成员控制，不受中央政府影响。

- 由于规则嵌入到代码中，不需要管理者，因此消除了任何官僚主义或层级障碍。
- DAO的财务交易记录和程序规则存储在区块链上。
