# Service Models and Challenges

## Cloud deployment models 

### Public

Made available to the general public

### Private

The cloud is used solely by an organization (e.g. HKUST, Facebook, HSBC) 

May reside in-house or off-premise

### Hybid

Composed of multiple clouds (private, public, etc.) that remain independent entities, but interoperate using standard or proprietary protocols
