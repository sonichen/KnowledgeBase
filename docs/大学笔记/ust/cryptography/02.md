## Modern cryptography

Core principles of modern crypto

• **Formal definitions**	

- Precise, mathematical model and definition of what security means

• **Assumptions**

- Clearly stated and unambiguous

• **Proofs of security**

- Move away from design-break-patch cycle

## How to do definitions, assumptions and security

## Defining secure encryption

Perfect secrecy

## Probability review

- *Random variable*
- Probability distribution for a random variable 
- *Event*
- Conditional probability: probability that one event occurs, *given that* some other event occurred – Pr[A | B] = Pr[A and B]/Pr[B]
- Two random variables X, Y are *independent* if for all x, y: Pr[X=x | Y=y] = Pr[X=x]

### Notation

• **K** (key space) – set of all possible keys

• **C** (ciphertext space) – set of all possible 

ciphertexts



### Probability distributions

Let K be a random variable denoting the key

​			– K ranges over **K**

Fix some encryption scheme (Gen, Enc, Dec)

​	– Gen defines a probability distribution for K: 

 			Pr[K = k] = Pr[Gen outputs key k]

​	– Generally the uniform distribution, but not always
