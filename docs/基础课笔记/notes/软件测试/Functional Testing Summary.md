Functional Testing Summary
• Equivalence Class Testing:
Defines condition or error classes to help reduce the number of tests. It assumes that a test of a representative value within a class also tests all values or conditions within that class.

• Boundary Value Testing:
Tests each edge condition of an equivalence class.
Combinational Testing:
Produces truth table for combinational effect of multiple input parameters.

• Random Testing:
Used to estimate the quality of the software in a statistical manner.

• Error Guessing:
Produces test cases based on intuitive and expert knowledge to discover potential faults and to design focused test cases.
